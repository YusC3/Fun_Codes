Hungry George:
This is a game designed to test For “each” loop knowledge. 
Description:
George is really hungry, and he’ll eat anything! George always has one favorite and one least favorite item, but don’t tell anyone! 
Design a menu of SIX items. Set one of those six items to something George really likes, and one to something George doesn’t.
The object of the game is to be able to guess the correctly George’s FAVORITE and LEAST FAVORITE menu item from your partners menu and vice versa.

Run Time:
FAVORITE: George will eat 3 of his favorite item and it will show up on his “eaten” list
LEAST FAVORITE: George will NOT eat this and it will not show up on his “eaten” list
All other items: George may or may not eat these items. If (by random choice) he eats >0 of this item, it will show up in his “eaten” list and he will have eaten SOME RANDOM NUMBER greater than 0 but less than 3.
Each round, menu items are chosen from the full_menu to make a current_menu at RANDOM (random library). Then George will check if the items on the current menu are his FAVORITE, LEAST FAVORITE, or OTHER and he will eat, not eat, or might eat each accordingly

The player who can guess the other George’s FAVORITE and LEAST FAVORITE menu item first wins!
The players can design their menu as wacky as they want as long as George has one FAVORITE and LEAST FAVORITE from the full_menu list.
Players can run the other players code as many times as they need, but they cannot look at the source code itself.
